#Feature For Listing Posts

## As an administrator, I want to see the list of posts so that I can see the most recent posts published by users

### Description 

There should be a component that fetches the posts and lists them listed by posterâ€™s names, post excerpt, date posted.
The details of the items in the list will be displayed using a pop-up when a given list item is clicked

On the pop-up there will be the following buttons:

Edit button
Delete button
Close icon

### Acceptance criteria:

Given the admin is logged in when they select posts in the navigation bar, then they are taken to a page with a list of all posts on the platform.
These will be listed with the most recent on top.
The list should display a maximum of 50 posts per loading/page
