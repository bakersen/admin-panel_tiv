#Feature For Listing Posts

## As an administrator, I want to see the list of all events on MyVillage.

### Description 

There should be a component that fetches the posts and lists them.
The details of the items in the list will be accessed using right-hand drawer when a given list item is clicked.

The user should be able to do the following;
*Delete an item from the list
*Edit the title and events date
*Search within the list


### Acceptance criteria:

Given the admin is logged in when they select an event in the navigation bar, then they are taken to a page with a list of all events on the MyVillage platform.
These will be listed with the most recent on top.
The list should display a maximum of 50 posts per loading/page
